<h1>Program Overview</h1>
<p>The SFSU Industrial/Organizational Psychology Masters of Science program at has been in existence since the early 1960´s. It is a two-year course of study requiring 36 graduate level semester units. The program is firmly grounded in the scientist/practitioner model and provides an educational foundation for students who plan to do professional work in the field or continue their education in I/O.  Primary emphasis in the I/O Graduate Program has been placed on the theoretical and empirical foundations of Psychology. Although I/O Psychology is clearly an applied discipline, our faculty believe that the most valuable educational experience is one in which skills and knowledge are developed through an understanding of basic concepts, methods and research in the field of I/O Psychology.</p>

<p>The Program attracts applicants from undergraduate institutions throughout the country and abroad. Currently 80% of our students admitted to the program majored in Psychology as an undergraduate. Typically, 9-12 new students enroll each academic year. Because it is a two-year program, this means that there are usually 18-24 active I/O graduate students at any given time.  </p>

<h1>Coursework</h1>

<h2>PREREQUISITE COURSEWORK</h2>
<p>
The coursework prerequisites are: Five undergraduate courses (total of 15 units) of psychology, and a course in intermediate statistics. If you have not already completed the intermediate statistics course, you may complete it during your first semester as a graduate student. (You must earn a grade of “B” or better.)</p>

<p>
Because so many incoming students have not taken intermediate statistics, we have planned for the course to be included in the program and you will see it in the following example.
</p>

<h2>FIRST YEAR COURSEWORK</h2>
<p>Most of the coursework in the MS Program is done during the first year, and prepares students for the second year of internship, independent study and research.</p>

<p>Coursework takes the form of weekly seminars. In these seminars, a small group of students meet with a professor for a 3-hour session of discussion on technical and theoretical material. Typical coursework for the first year may include:</p>

	<h3><a href=#>Click here for a full description of courses (links to Appendix B)</a></h3>
	<ul>
	<li><h3>Fall Semester</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>PSY 761 Industrial/Organizational Psychology</li>
		<li>PSY 765 Industrial Training Program Development</li>
		<li>PSY 571 Statistical Analysis of Psychological Research (Prerequisite Course)</li>
		<li>Elective** or Writing Course</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Spring Semester</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>PSY 760 Seminar in Organizational Psychology</li>
		<li>PSY 762 Seminar in Industrial Psychology</li>
		<li>PSY 770 Research Methods and Techniques</li>
		<li>PSY 772 Applications of Multiple Regression</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<h2>SECOND YEAR COURSEWORK</h2>
<p>In the fall semester, students complete an internship and often take one elective course. In the spring semester, students take a course in organizational change and complete a culminating experience in order to finish the program. The culminating experience can be a Thesis or a Comprehensive Examination. Typical coursework for the second year may include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><h3>Fall Semester</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>PSY 769 Field Experience in I/O Psychology</li>
		<li>PSY 768 Seminar to Accompany Field Experience</li>
		<li>Elective Course**</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Spring Semester</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>PSY 766 Psychological Foundations of Org. Change</li>
		<li>PSY 896 Directed Reading and Master´s Comprehensive Written Examination or PSY 898 Master´s Thesis and Oral Defense of Thesis</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p class="small"> <em>Students must take at least two electives to complete the necessary units for the program. The electives can be taken during the first year or second year of the program. A wide variety of elective courses are available, subject to approval by your advisor. You should consider your particular interests and career goals in selecting these courses. Some students take additional courses in research methodology or other psychology courses. Some go outside the department for their electives and take courses in business, for example.</em></p>

<h1> Thesis and Comprehensive Examination </h1>
<p>For the culminating experience, a student can choose to conduct a Thesis or to take a Comprehensive Examination based on a discussion with advisors about his or her specific needs and interests. The following paragraph briefly describes the characteristics of the Thesis and Comprehensive Examination.</p>

<p>A thesis research focuses on a narrowly defined interest within the Industrial-Organizational Psychology field. The Thesis is a more creative activity compared to the Comprehensive Exam. Theses will often be recommended to students who are interested in pursuing a Doctoral Degree after graduation. In contrast, the Comprehensive Exam provides the opportunity to review, synthesize, and demonstrate a student’s knowledge in broad areas of I/O Psychology. For the Comprehensive Exam, a reading list of current literature is developed by the I/O faculty based on five topics that committee members have chosen (approximately 15-20 books, chapters and/or articles per topic). At the date of the examination (usually in early May), the committee will prepare one essay question for each topic and the student will be allowed approximately 8 hours to complete the exam, over two days. Please refer to the I/O Handbook for more details.</p>
